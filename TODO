Pay debt:
  * Consider whether we want another layer of sugar over the template thing?
  * Document and anchor the namespacing and the various namespace aware functions.  Semantics keep shifting.
     -  Get the demos idiomatic.  Document the idioms.
  *  Make more declarative? (div id: "counter" (get-state "number")) 
    - React still wins over the document.getEl... stuff.
    - Need to decide, though if this should stop us from using things as-is.  The JS isn't that long or that bad...


Take loan:
  * Port over something like Google's MDC components -- Use quickstart:
      <head>
        <link href="https://unpkg.com/material-components-web@latest/dist/material-components-web.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/material-components-web@latest/dist/material-components-web.min.js"></script>
      </head>
  Now just make scoped components out of everything... 

  Meta components that show code for making components.  Can "write" the code by manipulating other components. (code (pre ...))?
 
  Tests
