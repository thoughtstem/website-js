Pay debt:
  * BUG: See picker-maker in color-picker.  Won't create multipl color-pickers
    - Homing in on a simpler way -- with html <template> tags.  But it isn't quite working. 
    - Gotta pin down how namespaces will work in JavaScript.  If we can implement them at the template load boundary, that's ideal...  



  * See warts in clicker.rkt, want to do (col-4 ...) on a component and get back something that (inject-component ...) can still use
    - (wrap ...) is a bandaid for the mean time...
  * Document and anchor the namespacing and the various namespace aware functions.  Semantics keep shifting.
     -  Get the demos idiomatic.  Document the idioms.
  *  Make more declarative? (div id: "counter" (get-state "number")) 
    - React still wins over the document.getEl... stuff.
    - Need to decide, though if this should stop us from using things as-is.  The JS isn't that long or that bad...

Take loan:
  * Port over something like Google's MDC components -- Use quickstart:
      <head>
        <link href="https://unpkg.com/material-components-web@latest/dist/material-components-web.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/material-components-web@latest/dist/material-components-web.min.js"></script>
      </head>
  Now just make scoped components out of everything... 

  Meta components that show code for making components.  Can "write" the code by manipulating other components. (code (pre ...))?
 
  Tests

  More demos to prove the approach
