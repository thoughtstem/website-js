Known Bugs:
  * Meta components that show code for making components.  Can "write" the code by manipulating other components.
  * make (getEl ...) smart about things like 'background-color -> 'backgroundColor
  * lists inside of (enclose ...) are confusing.  I keep getting them wrong.
  [DONE? (callback ...) to the rescue]  Color picker sliders only work in one direction.  Fixing this will require cleaning up the (call ...) semantics -- which will require coming up with some kind of abstractions over lambdas.
    - (call 'change "red" 'amount) is a gross, degenerate callback that requires knowing that the lexical context it's getting embedded into has an 'amount variable in scope. 
      - It might work, but it's not what we want.  The abstractions leak if we go that route.  
  If component A creates B and C, both of which are clickers -- their ids will be the same.  Convert the (inject-js ...) function to generate a new namespace at runtime.
  @-reader sometimes confusingly inserts a space "@(id "test")"  -> " ns245_test" 
  * Document and anchor the namespacing and the various namespace aware functions.  Semantics keep shifting.

Need:
  Tests
  More demos to prove the approach
