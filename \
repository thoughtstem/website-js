@defmodule[website-js]

It's a way to author front-end web components that are:

@list{
  @list-item{Syntactically like HTML, but with encapsulated behavior.}
  @list-item{Can be defined from other components -- like building blocks.}
  @list-item{Can produce other component at runtime.}
  @list-item{Can only affect themselves and components they may have produced.}
  @list-item{Are first-class values that can be returned from functions and manipulated as data structures at Racket run-time (which, btw, is compile-time for the program that runs in the browser)}
}

It's basically React, but with a Lispy twist.
