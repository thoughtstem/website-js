This might even be a preferable strategy in some cases.  It is the most flexible &ndash; i.e., you can commit whatever JavaScript attrocities you might want, including having one component mess with the other if you so desire.</p><p>But if you&rsquo;re committed to syntactic simplicity and further component encapsulation, we can use the above to start building nice linguistic abstractions.</p><p>First, I let&rsquo;s observe that good composable UI components have a few things in common.  In fact, they happen to be the things that React provides nice abstractions for:</p><ul><li><p>State, which values that change at runtime and are local to instances of the component.</p></li><li><p>Props, which are values known at compile time and passed in by parent components, and which are local to instances of the component.</p></li><li><p>A way for parents to pass in callbacks as props.</p></li><li><p>A way to define functions that are local to the component &ndash; with names that can be referenced within the current scope, and which can be supplied as callbacks to child components.</p></li></ul><p>This allows for the kind of secure component ecosystem that React can provide.  Information flows into components via parents only.  Information flows out of components to parents only &ndash; and only via callbacks.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s consider this to be the opposite extreme of the most recent code example &ndash; instead of being able to commit whatever JavaScript attrocities we might want, we may now only commit attrocities that follow a strict set of inter-component communication rules.</p><p>This helps component designers trust the components they are using to build their own out of.  [I would argue that this exact restriction (and corresponding increase in code correctness) has been at the heart of React&rsquo;s meteoric rise to popularity.  That &ndash; along with the JSX syntax, which allows mixing of JS code with stuff that "feels" like HTML &ndash; which aids our minds when we reason about the structure of the DOM.]</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a stab at getting all of the above:</p><p><span class="stt">#lang racket</span><span class="stt">

Yes: There will always be odd, unique, weird needs.  And for that, the escape hatch into dangerous JS territory &ndash; a tool always at hand.  But when we do the sorts of things that pure user interfaces most often require &ndash; what linguistic tools most assist us?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question, but my next steps are to try converting a standard component library &ndash; like React&rsquo;s Material UI or Material Design Components.  This will illuminate the powerful abstractions that must come next.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Client-.Side_.Rendering)"></a>Client-Side Rendering</h3><p>Started to build a calendar and realized there are some problems here.  The language you use to define behaviour (JS) doesn&rsquo;t have a syntax for describing components (like Racket does).  So you can&rsquo;t, for example, say:</p><p>When you click "New Event", add a new event component to the calendar and rerender the calendar.</p><p>How would you even do that in the current system?    A calendar can take the id of some template to inject, and</p><p>The callback mechanism gives children a way to communicate with parents (i.e. a way for parents to subscribe to things of interest and be notified).  But in React a parent can render out a new version of a child, with different props.  Feels like we need something like that here...</p><p>Currently, a parent could delete a component and inject a new version of it.  But that new version would have to be described in gross JS.  Or it would have to have been known at compile time.</p><p>For the calendar, it doesn&rsquo;t work.  There are infinitely many ways to have events on calendars.  So whatever is adding events to the calendar needs to be able to take user input, construct new events, and rerender the calendar with those events.</p><p>Currently, we can render out components.  Can we render out component functions &ndash; javascript functions that return either a component string, or a component dom object (wrapped in a template?).  Whatever it is, it needs to be passable into other such functions, so that on the JS side (as on the Racket side), components can be assembled in building-block fashion.</p><p>First stop on the quest: Racket script.  Does it let me compile out my Racket functions to JS in a useful way?</p><p>Hmmm.  Just looked at it.  Seems like too much complexity for what I want. Plus the playground demo seemed slow.  I&rsquo;m going to try rolling my own.  My domain is smaller, so I feel I might be able to hack to gether a much simpler compiler than RacketScript.</p><p>Okay, so we want some kind of way for parents to affect the runtime state of their children.  Their children have functions.  Can parents just reach in and call those?  Or pass in the ones to be called?</p><p>Figured out that if you have a reference to some dom element with a component inside, you can extract the namespace (brittle process atm), and call whatever functions you want.  It&rsquo;s like having an object reference and calling the object&rsquo;s methods.  I THINK this is enough to start building out cool components.  Maybe it&rsquo;s not as slick as React, but I have a feeling its flexibilty will be its strength.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Abstractions_.I_m_.Cobbling_.Together)"></a>Abstractions I&rsquo;m Cobbling Together</h3><p>See: components/calendar.rkt</p><p>I&rsquo;m trying to build a calendar that&rsquo;s extensible.  I want the calendar to take its controls as input (i.e. widgets to add events, etc).  I don&rsquo;t what the calendar to have to decide what those look like.</p><p>So the calendar&rsquo;s interface will take a component that it will grant addEvent access to.  This other component will call addEvent whenever it wants &ndash; likely in response to user input, and some kind of text field (for the event name) and time picker (for the event time).</p><p>Weird thing is, the controls way of constructing an event object is to store it in a template.  But that&rsquo;s not a real object.  It&rsquo;s more of a prototype.  Its instance methods can&rsquo;t be called until it is constructed.  Should we be constructing it locally?  WHat does that mean?  Inject it into the dom?  That feels dirty for some reason.</p><p>So my workaround was to pass along a callback to be applied wherever the event object gets injected.  It&rsquo;s like applying a change lazily.</p><p>Anyway, it works, but it was frought with syntactic difficulties, and I don&rsquo;t love the story as it stands.  Feels like we should cover up as much of that channel as possible.  Or we need to figure out a different way.</p><p>On the other hand, it is kind of cool that the event&rsquo;s way of letting you change its name is to provide a changeName function, which is what the controls ultimately call after injection.</p><p>So far, we&rsquo;ve managed to build everything on top of namespaced functions and an extremely tight security model.  You get to reason object-orientedly on the front end, and functionally on the back end.</p><p><span class="stt">(calendar "July"
